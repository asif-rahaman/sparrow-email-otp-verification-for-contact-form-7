# Sparrow Email OTP Verification for Contact Form 7

Sparrow Email OTP Verification for Contact Form 7 provides a robust security layer for your website by verifying user email addresses before form submission. This effectively blocks bots, spammers, and malicious actors from flooding your inbox with fake data or invalid leads.

## 🚀 Why This Plugin Is Different

Most existing OTP plugins require you to pay for their proprietary API or use their specific SMTP service to send codes. This often leads to unexpected monthly costs and vendor lock-in.

This plugin is built with a **"Your Server, Your Rules"** philosophy. It sends OTP codes using the native `wp_mail()` function, meaning it utilizes your website's default mail configuration or your preferred SMTP service. There are no extra costs, no hidden fees, and no third-party accounts required.

## ✨ Features

* **Block Bots & Spam:** Ensure every submission comes from a person with a valid, accessible email address.
* **Cost-Effective:** Zero cost to send OTPs—it uses your existing server or SMTP setup.
* **Privacy First:** No data is sent to external verification APIs; everything stays on your server.
* **Security-First Rate Limiting:** Includes built-in protection to prevent OTP request abuse by limiting users to 3 attempts per 5 minutes per IP address.
* **Smart Detection:** Automatically finds the email field in your Contact Form 7 forms.
* **Multi-Form Support:** Can be used in multiple forms on the same page without ID conflicts.
* **Lightweight Performance:** Optimized with a minimal footprint to ensure your site remains fast and passes Core Web Vitals.
